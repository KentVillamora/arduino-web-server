# arduino-web-server
An adaptation of the codes found online on making ESP8266 a web server, tailored to my own coding style and application

As majority of the codes here are inspired, if not copy-pasted, from various sites and forums, I will cite the URLs where I copied them from to give them their due credits.

This is a work-in-progress and more of my first journey to using GitHub as a repository of my source code. I have coded some Excel macros in the past, so I don't consider my self totally uninitiated in programming; however, as someone who never formally took a degree in programming, I hope veiwers of this code can find themselves a little forgiving for any coding errors or absudity in my code.

Thanks and feel free to utilize the contents of this repository.
